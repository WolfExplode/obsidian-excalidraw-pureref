/**
 * Fixes the bounds of freshly-inserted local media so they match the file's real
 * aspect ratio.
 *
 * WHY EXCALIDRAW GETS THIS "WRONG": a video is inserted as an `embeddable`
 * element, not an `image`. Excalidraw only measures intrinsic pixel dimensions
 * for images — on insert it reads `naturalWidth/naturalHeight` off the decoded
 * bitmap and sizes the element to that ratio (App.tsx). An embeddable wraps an
 * opaque iframe with no reliable intrinsic size, so instead of loading the media
 * it looks the size up in a hardcoded aspect-ratio table keyed on the embed URL
 * (element/embeddable.ts: YouTube 560×315, generic 560×840, …). A local video
 * matches no entry and lands on the generic default box (the Obsidian plugin uses
 * a 500×500 square), so a 16:9 clip gets letterboxed. There is no per-file "fit
 * to media" setting — only one global default embeddable size.
 *
 * THE FIX: we subscribe to each Excalidraw view's `onChange` (see leaf-scanner.ts
 * for that shared lifecycle) and, the first time an embeddable linking to a local
 * media file appears, load the file just far enough to read `videoWidth/
 * videoHeight` (or an image's natural size for animated gif/webp embeds) and
 * rewrite the element's box to that ratio — preserving the placeholder's centre
 * and visual area — as one undoable step.
 *
 * Elements already present when we subscribe are seeded as "seen" and never
 * touched, so a video you deliberately stretched is left alone.
 *
 * TRACKING IS BY ELEMENT ID: each new insertion needs fitting, even if it
 * points at a file already present on this board. This includes the “Use the
 * file already in the Vault” choice. File-path tracking wrongly treated that
 * valid insertion as a copy and left its 500×500 placeholder untouched. Only
 * element IDs present as the board loaded are protected as pre-existing work.
