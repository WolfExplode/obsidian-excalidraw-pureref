/**
 * Test runner: bundle each tests/*.test.ts with esbuild, then hand the output to
 * node:test.
 *
 * WHY BUNDLE FIRST: the modules under test are TypeScript and import each other
 * with extensionless specifiers ("./pack-elements"). Node's own type-stripping
 * cannot resolve those, and adding ts-node/tsx/vitest would mean a new
 * dependency. esbuild is already a devDependency for the plugin build, so
 * reusing it keeps the test setup dependency-free and guarantees the tests
 * compile through exactly the same pipeline as the shipped bundle.
 *
 * Only modules free of a runtime `obsidian` import can be tested this way —
 * that is the point of keeping pack-elements.ts, zorder.ts, and crop-geometry.ts
 * dependency-free. Anything importing Notice/Plugin at runtime needs Obsidian and
 * is out of scope here.
