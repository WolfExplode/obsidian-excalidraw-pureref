/**
 * Contract test against the real ExcalidrawAutomate class, not our own guesses
 * about its shape.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: our code reaches into another plugin's API surface
 * (window.ExcalidrawAutomate / plugin.ea) through hand-written TypeScript
 * interfaces (ExcalidrawAutomateLike, etc.) that describe what we *assume*
 * that object looks like. TypeScript only checks our code against those
 * assumed interfaces — it has no way to catch an assumption that's simply
 * wrong, because there's no compile-time link to the real upstream class. A
 * method that was invented, renamed, or removed upstream compiles cleanly and
 * fails silently at runtime (most call sites use `?.()`, so a nonexistent
 * method just does nothing instead of throwing). This test closes that gap by
 * grepping the vendored upstream source directly.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: reference/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-master, a local-only
 * checkout documented in AGENTS.md ("Reference material"). It is gitignored,
 * so on a fresh clone (or in CI) it won't exist — every test below skips
 * itself with a pointer to AGENTS.md rather than failing, since its absence
 * says nothing about whether our code is correct.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH: the vendored copy is a point-in-time snapshot,
 * not the live installed plugin — see the existing project lesson that a
 * vendored/declared API surface can lag what's actually shipped. Re-pull
 * reference/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-master periodically (see AGENTS.md) so
 * this test is checking against something reasonably current, and still
 * exercise the real feature in the live app before trusting this alone.
