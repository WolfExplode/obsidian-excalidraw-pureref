# Excalidraw interaction overrides

Excalidraw PureRef deliberately changes a small set of Excalidraw interactions
to support a reference-board workflow. These rules apply while the host plugin
is enabled, both in the normal Obsidian Excalidraw view and in an editable
PureRef Popout unless noted otherwise.

## Pointer gestures

| Gesture | Plugin behavior | Replaces or changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alt-drag** | Moves normally; it does **not** duplicate elements. | Excalidraw's built-in Alt-drag duplication is disabled. |
| **Alt+Shift-drag** with one or more images selected | Dominant left/right movement flips the selected images horizontally; dominant up/down movement flips them vertically. | Replaces the normal drag for that gesture. |
| Hold **C** and drag with images selected | Crops the selected images to the dragged screen rectangle. | Replaces normal canvas drag while C is held. |
| **Alt+double-click** with cropped images selected | Removes the plugin's custom viewport crop when present; otherwise removes Excalidraw's native crop, restoring each image in place. | Adds a consistent uncrop gesture for both crop layers. |
| Double-click a custom-cropped image | Opens Excalidraw's native crop editor for the generated image. | No longer removes the plugin's custom viewport crop. |
| Right-button drag in an editable PureRef Popout | Moves the Popout OS window. | Replaces the normal right-click drag only in the Popout. |
| **Ctrl/Cmd+wheel** or pinch zoom in an editable PureRef Popout | Changes zoom by Excalidraw's base linear wheel delta, anchored at the cursor. | Removes Excalidraw's additional logarithmic acceleration above 100% zoom. Normal Excalidraw views retain native zoom behavior. |

All image crop and flip operations are one undoable Board change. A gesture with
no selected image is left alone, except that plain Alt-drag is still normalized
to a normal move so it cannot duplicate a newly clicked element.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Plugin behavior | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+−** / **Ctrl++** with selected elements | Changes selected element opacity by 10%. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **Ctrl+−** / **Ctrl++** without a selection | Does nothing in a normal Excalidraw view. Changes the editable PureRef Popout's whole-window opacity by 5%. | As stated. The Popout consumes this shortcut so Excalidraw does not zoom. |
| **Ctrl+Arrow** | Packs selected packable references toward that edge. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **Ctrl+Shift+P** | Rearranges selected packable references into a compact layout. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **Ctrl+]** / **Ctrl+[** with a selection | Bring Forward / Send Backward jumps the selection past every element ahead of (or behind) it that its bounding box does not overlap, stopping just past the first one that does. Falls back to Excalidraw's native one-slot-per-press behavior if the selection touches a group or a frame. | Normal view and editable Popout. See [Overlap-aware Bring Forward / Send Backward](overlap-aware-zorder.md). Ctrl+Shift+]/[ (Bring to Front / Send to Back) are untouched — they already jump to the absolute front/back in one native call. |
| **G** / **R** / **S** with selected elements | Starts a Blender-style move, rotation, or uniform scale around the selection center. Move to preview; left-click or Enter commits; Esc or right-click cancels. Hold **Shift** during rotation to snap to 15° increments. The transform runs through Excalidraw's native pointer pipeline, so bound text, connected arrows, frames, snapping, and other element relationships behave like a mouse transform. | Normal view and editable Popout. See [Excalidraw shortcut interception](../integrations/excalidraw-shortcut-interception.md) for how this shadows Excalidraw's own G/R/S bindings, verified live through community plugin 2.27.3. |
| **R** without a selection | Does not select the Rectangle tool. Excalidraw's **2** shortcut remains available. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **Alt+R** | Resets selected elements' rotation to 0, each element turning about its own center. With no selection it is a harmless no-op. The host plugin owns the key only while a Board is active, so another Alt+R command (such as Templater's) remains available everywhere else. | Normal view and editable Popout. See [Obsidian hotkey interception](../integrations/obsidian-hotkey-interception.md). |
| **Alt+S** with selected images | Resets each image to 100% scale — its native pixel size — about its own center. A natively cropped image resets to its visible crop, never re-exposing cropped-away content. Rotation and flips are preserved. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **Alt+S** otherwise | Does nothing. Excalidraw's "toggle object snap" shortcut is dropped because it also force-disables grid mode; toggle object snap from the canvas context menu instead. | Normal view and editable Popout. |
| **X** | Deletes the selected elements. | Replaces Excalidraw's **X** shortcut for the free-draw tool. Normal Excalidraw deletion rules, including frames, bindings, and groups, still apply. |
| **Ctrl+Alt+Left** / **Right** with two or more images selected | Resizes the selected images, centered in place, to their average displayed height / width. | Normal view and editable Popout. Also available from the canvas context menu: **Normalize → Height / Width**. |
| **Ctrl+Alt+Up** / **Down** with two or more images selected | Resizes the selected images, centered in place, to their average displayed area / average native-image scale. | Normal view and editable Popout. Also available from the canvas context menu: **Normalize → Size / Scale**. |
| **F11** | Opens or closes the PureRef Popout for the active Board. | An Excalidraw Board. |
| **F10** | Switches an existing editable Popout and its read-only transparent reference mode. | Only when one of those modes exists. |
| **Ctrl+Shift+E** | Exports every selected image/video/embed to a folder chosen via the native OS dialog. A natively cropped image is rendered to a fresh PNG holding only its visible crop (flips included); an uncropped image or any other local media file is copied byte-for-byte. | Normal view and editable Popout, when a Board is the active leaf. |

## Canvas context menu

- **Cut / Copy / Paste are removed** from Excalidraw's native right-click
  context menu. There, they operate on Excalidraw's own element clipboard
  (selected elements only), not the OS clipboard, which read as a bug to
  users expecting ordinary system copy/paste of an image. The **Ctrl+X** /
  **Ctrl+C** / **Ctrl+V** keyboard shortcuts still work exactly as before —
  only the confusing menu entries are gone.
- **Crop image is removed** from the context menu. It's redundant with the
  plugin's own hold-**C**-and-drag crop gesture and with double-clicking a
  custom-cropped image to open the native crop editor (see the pointer
  gestures table above).
- **Find Duplicates is added** to the context menu when exactly one element is
  selected. It searches the whole board for other elements with matching
  content — for images, the same underlying file (by default, any crop of it
  counts too, including this plugin's own hold-C custom crop — see
  `TREAT_CROPS_AS_DUPLICATES` in
  [duplicate-finder.ts](../../src/duplicate-finder.ts)); for embeddables
  (video, PDF, web embeds), the same link/vault file; for other element types,
  matching geometry, style, and (for text) content — and selects every match
  found alongside the original, or shows a Notice if none exist. **Ctrl/Cmd+F**
  also runs Find Duplicates instead of Excalidraw's native "Find text on
  canvas" whenever exactly one element is selected; with nothing selected (or
  more than one element), Ctrl/Cmd+F still opens the native Find as usual.

## Popout defaults

Editable PureRef Popouts are always-on-top and hide Obsidian chrome. They also
enable Excalidraw's **overlap** box-selection mode, so a marquee selects every
element it touches rather than only elements fully enclosed by it. The plugin
preserves a Popout's viewport and native window opacity across editable/read-only
mode switches. While at least one editable Popout is open, the plugin temporarily
turns off Excalidraw's global **zoom to fit on view resize** setting. This keeps
the canvas from refitting while the Popout is moved or resized, and restores the
user's prior setting after the last Popout closes; because Excalidraw owns this
setting globally, the normal Board view is affected for that interval too.

## Import and media behavior

- The plugin sanitizes dropped attachment filenames that cannot safely appear in
  Obsidian wikilinks, then passes the drop through Excalidraw's normal importer.
  This works around an Obsidian vault-naming limitation, not an Excalidraw
  behavior; see
  [Obsidian wikilink-unsafe attachment names](../integrations/obsidian-wikilink-attachment-names.md).
- If Excalidraw's “Insert File From Vault” dialog presents exactly one choice,
  the plugin selects it automatically.
- Inserted local videos and animated images are resized to their intrinsic aspect
  ratio after Excalidraw has added them.
- Converting newly-inserted `.gif`/`.webp`/`.apng` files into playing
  embeddables is handled natively by Excalidraw as of
  [zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin@fce2bc1](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/commit/fce2bc11ffd1187def7db611f91afe2a10f7bdd4);
  this plugin no longer implements its own conversion for it.
- Animated-image embeddables now stretch to fill their element box when
  resized, matching video/pdf/markdown embeddables. This works around an
  upstream Obsidian Canvas limitation; see
  [Obsidian Canvas image-embed stretch fix](../integrations/obsidian-canvas-image-stretch-fix.md).
- **Known limitation, not fixed by this plugin:** embeddables (video, pdf,
  markdown, animated images, web embeds) always render on top of ordinary
  canvas-drawn elements, regardless of "Send to back" / "Bring to front".
  This is an upstream Excalidraw core limitation; see
  [Excalidraw embeddable z-order limitation](../integrations/excalidraw-embeddable-z-order-limitation.md).
- A multi-file media import is automatically arranged as a compact PureRef-style
  block. Only media created by that import moves; existing Board content stays
  in place. Packing occurs after Obsidian Excalidraw's native
  `synchronizeWithData()` import-sync promise resolves, rather than on a delay
  or on the earlier vault-save event; this prevents the importer from restoring
  its pre-pack scene snapshot over videos and other embeddables.

These integrations are designed to be additive where possible. The explicit
gesture and shortcut overrides above are the intentional exceptions.
