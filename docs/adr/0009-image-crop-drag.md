# PureRef-style hold-C drag crop, built on Excalidraw's native crop

## Decision

Holding **C** and dragging a rectangle over the Board crops images to that
rectangle, mirroring PureRef's crop gesture. If images are selected, all of them
are cropped; if nothing is selected, the gesture is a no-op.
It is bound per window and so works in the main window and every Popout.

Upright images are driven through Excalidraw's own `crop` element field. Rotated
images require a generated viewport image because a screen-aligned polygon cannot
be represented by that axis-aligned field. In both cases the full source image
is retained, and the change is a single undoable step.

The generated image uses quality-1 WebP for JPEG sources when a runtime round
trip preserves alpha and differs from PNG by no more than four channel values
at antialiased edges. Other sources and unsupported encoders use PNG. This
reduces the bytes registered and reloaded for large photo Boards.

## Invariants and consequences

- A crop intersects the image's current visible region; it never re-exposes
  pixels removed by an earlier crop. Uncrop remains an explicit operation.
- Flipped upright images remain native crops, with source coordinates adjusted
  for the flip.
- Rotated crops compose from the retained original source rather than stacking
  raster generations. The accumulated visible polygon and source relationship
  are stored in `customData`.
- Generated attachments are registered before use and deleted only after the
  live scene stops referencing them. See the
  [generated-image lifecycle](../integrations/obsidian-excalidraw-generated-images.md).
- The implementation uses the public Excalidraw runtime surface, consistent
  with ADR 0001; it does not import Excalidraw internals.

User-visible gestures and uncrop behavior are documented in
[Interaction overrides](../behavior/user-interaction-overrides.md). Coordinate
math, file registration, replacement, and cleanup belong in implementation and
integration documentation rather than this decision record.
